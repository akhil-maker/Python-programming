## Introduction to Python
* -> Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991 at CWI (Cemtrum Wiskunde & Informatica) Netherland.
* -> Python is General purpose, high level programming language.
* -> Python is dynamic

## Why Python?
* -> Simple & Easy to learn
* -> Platform independent
* -> Free & Open source
* -> Interpreted (bytecode-compiled)
* -> Rich Library Support
* -> Embeddable & Extensible
* -> Portable
* -> Robust

## Where python is used?
* -> Web frameworks and applications
* -> GUI-based desktop applications-> Graphic design, image processing applications, Games and scientific/Computational applications
* -> ML, AI, Neural networks
* -> Data science, data virtualization
* -> IOT 
* -> Database development

## Various Datatypes in Python
* Mutable data types in Python - their values can be modified after creation, slow in speed, readable, writable
-> List
-> Sets
-> Dictionary
* Immutable Data types in Python - their values cannot be modified after creation, fast in speed, only readable
-> Numbers - storing numeric values but same kind of data
-> Strings - store characters but same kind of data
-> Tuples
